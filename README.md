# Chrome-Extension

Developed an extension in the form of a pop-up box which can be used to store URLs that are important for the user.
It consists of three buttons "SAVE INPUT", "SAVE TAB" and "DELETE ALL".
SAVE INPUT -> Saves input entered by the user.
SAVE TAB -> Saves the URL of the current website that the user has opened.
DELETE ALL -> Deletes all URLs that were earlier saved by the user.
